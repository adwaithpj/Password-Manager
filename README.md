# PassMan - the password manager 💻🔐

This Python-Flutter based password manager, developed with Flet python, provides a secure and user-friendly way to generate, save, and manage passwords.The GUI is completely developed using [Flet](https://flet.dev/docs/) framework.

The backend uses robust **FastAPI** for both authentication and data processing. Implemented PostgreSQL for the database and this enables cross platform.😀

You can view the all your passwords, search them and add new password.It has real time updation and deletion. 

Password is saved and hashed by users own key which is again generated by Cryptographic algorithms. Only users who created their password can decrypt them. This increases the secruity.

The application is live for Windows and Android at the moment.
